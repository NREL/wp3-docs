# WP3 Benchmarking Documentation

This repository contains a Jekyll website which serves as documentation for the NREL WP3/PRUF Benchmarking project.

When the website is built, markdown documents within the pages subdirectory are converted into webpages. Each page allows feedback with Disqus.

To build the site locally you can:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll build
```
To serve it up:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You can access the live version of the site at http://nrel.github.io/wp3-docs/.
